**Project Title:** Assessment of Contaminant Transport Dynamics in Aquatic Ecosystems in St. Louis: Implications of a Nuclear Waste Containment Facility on Water Quality  
**Research Period:** February – March 2024  

## Objective
This study aims to identify contaminants in freshwater systems linked to legacy nuclear waste in the Saint Louis region. The focus includes mapping the distribution of contaminants and evaluating containment procedures at management sites to ensure compliance with established safety thresholds.

## Project Description
Over the past six decades, multiple nuclear facilities in St. Louis have ceased operations, with varying levels of remediation applied. Despite containment efforts, leakages from these sites—such as the **Westlake Superfund Site** and **Weldon Spring**—have caused environmental and public health concerns. Assessments of these contaminant leakages have been limited in scope and scale, necessitating a broader investigation into their impact on water resources.

### Study Scope
Our project seeks to conduct a **region-wide assessment** of radioactive and non-radioactive contaminants in St. Louis’s freshwater systems. To achieve this, we will analyze water samples from **up to 50 sites** (Figure 1), testing for contaminants known to pose significant environmental and health risks:

- **Radioactive Contaminants**: Uranium  
- **Chemical Pollutants**: Nitrate, iron, rust (iron 3+), trichloroethylene  
- **Explosive Compounds & Derivatives**: 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, nitrobenzene  

Sample sites have been selected based on groundwater movement within local aquifers. At each location, **three independent water samples** will be collected and analyzed by the **WATER Institute at Saint Louis University**. The findings will be compiled into a comprehensive regional assessment of contaminant distribution.

By connecting SLU’s research efforts with pressing environmental and social concerns, this project aligns with the university’s mission of pursuing truth for the service of humanity.

## Anticipated Outcomes
The expected results of this research include:

- Insights into interactions between **waste containment systems** and **radioactive materials**, with implications for water quality.  
- Expanded validation of prior findings from other organizations and remediation efforts.  
- Identification of potential **disparities in contaminant distribution** across economically diverse communities.

By providing an in-depth analysis of contamination patterns, our research aims to contribute to future environmental policies and remediation strategies while addressing concerns about **water quality equity** in St. Louis.
